There are  students in this class whose names and grades are assembled to build the following list:

python students = [['Harry', 37.21], ['Berry', 37.21], ['Tina', 37.2], ['Akriti', 41], ['Harsh', 39]]

The lowest grade of 37.2  belongs to Tina. The second lowest grade of 37.21  belongs to both Harry and Berry, so we order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    m = s = float('inf') # Initialize variables to store the lowest and second lowest grades
    ms = []
    ss = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name = input()
        grade = float(input())
        if grade < m:
            s = m
            m = grade
            ss = ms.copy()
            ms = [name]
        elif grade == m:
            ms.append(name)
        elif grade < s:
            s = grade
            ss = [name]
        elif grade == s:
            ss.append(name)
    ss.sort()
    for student in ss:
        print(student)
