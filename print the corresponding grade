    45 to 50 - D
    50 to 60 - C

Using the input() function, ask the user to enter their grade and print the corresponding grade.

grade=int(input("Enter your grade:"))
if grade<25:
 print("your grade is:F")
elif grade>=25 and grade<45:
  print("your grade is:E")
elif grade>=45 and grade<50:
  print("your grade is:D")
elif grade>=50 and grade<60:
  print("your grade is:c")
elif grade>=60 and grade<80:
  print("your grade is:D")
